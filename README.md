# landmarks-app

The **LandmarksApp** is a simple iOS application built using **SwiftUI** as part of the **iOS Lab Course**. The app allows users to explore famous landmarks around the world. It features beautiful images, informative descriptions, and interactive maps to provide users with a more immersive experience.

This project was developed as part of the **iOS Lab Course** to gain hands-on experience in iOS development. The course focuses on building modern iOS applications using Swift and SwiftUI. In this project, we applied key concepts learned in the course, such as integrating **MapKit** for map views, creating custom SwiftUI components, and managing data with property wrappers.

## Features
- **MapView**: An interactive map displaying the location of a famous landmark, using `MapKit` and `MKCoordinateRegion`.
- **CircleImage**: A custom view that displays landmark images in a circular frame with a shadow effect.
- **Landmark Info**: Descriptive text and titles related to each landmark, providing insights about its location and significance.

## Requirements
- Xcode 12.0+ (or higher)
- iOS 14.0+ (or higher)

## App Structure
- **ContentView**: The main view containing the map, landmark image, and description.
- **CircleImage**: A custom view that displays a circular image with a white stroke and shadow effect.
- **MapView**: A view displaying the map with a region set to the coordinates of a specific landmark.

## Learning Objectives
This project helped us learn and practice the following concepts as part of the **iOS Lab Course**:
- Building custom views using **SwiftUI** components.
- Integrating **MapKit** for displaying interactive maps.
- Managing data and displaying information dynamically in a SwiftUI-based layout.
- Using **@State**, **@Binding**, and other property wrappers to handle data flow in the app.

## Acknowledgements
- The app utilizes **MapKit** for displaying maps.

## Course Information
This project is a result of the **iOS Lab Course**. The course focuses on iOS development and the application of Swift and SwiftUI for building modern mobile apps.
